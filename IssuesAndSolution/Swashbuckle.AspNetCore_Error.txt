To resolve the NU1101: Unable to find package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore error in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

Check NuGet Package Source Configuration:
Ensure that your NuGet package sources are correctly configured.

Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code.
Use the following command to list your current package sources:
sh
Copy code
dotnet nuget list source
Ensure that nuget.org is listed. If not, add it using:
sh
Copy code
dotnet nuget add source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json -n nuget.org
Add Swashbuckle.AspNetCore Package:
Add the Swashbuckle.AspNetCore package to your project.

In the terminal, navigate to your project directory.
Use the following command to add the package:
sh
Copy code
dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore
Restore Packages:
Restore the packages for your project to ensure all dependencies are downloaded.

Run the following command in the terminal:
sh
Copy code
dotnet restore
Check for typos:
Make sure there are no typos in the package name. The correct package name is Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.

Check Internet Connection:
Ensure that you have an active internet connection since NuGet needs to fetch the package from the online source.

Clear NuGet Cache:
Sometimes, clearing the NuGet cache can resolve issues with finding packages.

Run the following command to clear the cache:
sh
Copy code
dotnet nuget locals all --clear
After performing these steps, try restoring the packages again with dotnet restore and check if the issue is resolved.
