Error -
More than one DbContext was found. Specify which one to use. Use the '-Context' parameter 
for PowerShell commands and the '--context' parameter for dotnet commands.
Reason :
When you encounter the error "More than one DbContext was found. Specify which one to use," it means that your application contains multiple DbContext classes, 
and the tools are unable to determine which one to use automatically. To resolve this, you need to specify which DbContext to use in your command.


Solution :
 dotnet ef migrations add InitalCreate -c DataContext -o Data/Migrations
